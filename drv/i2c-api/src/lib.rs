//! Client API for the I2C server
//!
//! This API allows for access to I2C devices.  The actual I2C bus
//! communication occurs in a disjoint I2C server task; this API handles
//! marshalling (and unmarshalling) of messages to (and replies from) this
//! task to perform I2C operations.
//!
//! # I2C devices
//!
//! An I2C device is uniquely identified by a 5-tuple:
//!
//! - The I2C controller in the MCU
//! - The port for that controller, identifying a bus
//! - The multiplexer on the specified I2C bus, if any
//! - The segment on the multiplexer, if a multiplexer is specified
//! - The address of the device itself
//!
//! # Extended Capabilities
//!
//! This crate provides both traditional master operations and new slave mode 
//! operations for peer-to-peer protocols like MCTP:
//!
//! ## Master Mode Operations
//!
//! Traditional I2C operations where this device initiates transactions:
//!
//! - [`I2cDevice::read_reg`] - Read from a device register
//! - [`I2cDevice::write`] - Write data to a device
//! - [`I2cDevice::read_block`] - SMBus block read operations
//! - [`I2cDevice::write_read_reg`] - Combined write-then-read operations
//!
//! ## Slave Mode Operations (MCTP Support)
//!
//! New operations that allow this device to respond to incoming I2C transactions:
//!
//! - [`I2cDevice::configure_slave_address`] - Set up slave address
//! - [`I2cDevice::enable_slave_receive`] - Start listening for incoming messages
//! - [`I2cDevice::check_slave_buffer`] - Poll for received messages
//! - [`I2cDevice::disable_slave_receive`] - Stop slave mode
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Basic Master Operation
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use drv_i2c_api::*;
//! use userlib::TaskId;
//!
//! # fn example(i2c_task: TaskId) -> Result<(), ResponseCode> {
//! // Create device handle
//! let temp_sensor = I2cDevice::new(
//!     i2c_task,
//!     Controller::I2C1,
//!     PortIndex(0),
//!     None,  // No multiplexer
//!     0x48,  // Temperature sensor address
//! );
//!
//! // Read temperature register
//! let temp_raw: u16 = temp_sensor.read_reg(0x00u8)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## MCTP Slave Configuration
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use drv_i2c_api::*;
//! use userlib::TaskId;
//!
//! # fn example(i2c_task: TaskId) -> Result<(), ResponseCode> {
//! // Create device handle for MCTP endpoint
//! let mctp_device = I2cDevice::new(
//!     i2c_task,
//!     Controller::I2C1,
//!     PortIndex(0),
//!     None,
//!     0x1D,  // Our MCTP address
//! );
//!
//! // Configure as slave to receive MCTP messages
//! mctp_device.configure_slave_address(0x1D)?;
//! mctp_device.enable_slave_receive()?;
//!
//! // Poll for incoming messages
//! let mut messages = [SlaveMessage::default(); 4];
//! let msg_count = mctp_device.get_slave_messages(&mut messages)?;
//!
//! for i in 0..msg_count {
//!     let message = &messages[i];
//!     // Process MCTP message from message.source_address
//!     // Message data is available via message.data()
//!     handle_mctp_message(message.source_address, message.data())?;
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! # fn handle_mctp_message(source: u8, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), ResponseCode> { Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! All operations return `Result<T, ResponseCode>` where [`ResponseCode`] provides
//! detailed error information:
//!
//! - Hardware errors (bus lockup, device not responding)
//! - Configuration errors (invalid addresses, unsupported operations)
//! - Protocol errors (malformed messages, buffer overflows)
//!
//! # Task Reset Handling
//!
//! If the I2C server task is reset during operation, this API will detect the
//! reset condition and panic with "i2c reset". This ensures that client tasks
//! don't continue with stale state after a server restart.
//!
